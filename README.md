# QUIKTYME
RPG I'm learning from and developing with C++
/**
 * This is QUIK TYME (working title). An RPG written by Michael Howard.
 * Developing a full RPG (role playing game) with basic RPG mechanics
 * to tinker around with. Will become more complex as new ideas flow.
 * If it ever gets to being an actual playable full PC game, I have an solid
 * idea for a storyline. (a superhero-themed old school Final Fantasy-esque
 * turn based RPG). More along the lines of Earthbound/Mother because of non-
 * conventional style and humor. Battle system and play-style will probably
 * be inspired by Pokemon (gathering superheroes to create a super-team instead
 * monsters to beat the mess out of each other.)
 *
 * As the game grows more complex I want to implement a system where superheroes
 * randomly inquire to join or you can persuade heroes to join based on how
 * strong your team is and how well you work together. These contribute to your overall
 * renown, and contribute to lower level monsters/villains fearing you.
 * You can also acquire resources and build your own HQ. Maybe give heroes unorthodox
 * stats outside of battle (such as personal wealth levels, or if they're single)
 * which effects their availability or how much they can contribute to the team.
 *
 * But as of 8/31/2015, it's just a simple 1v1 text demo.
